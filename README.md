# dummy-data-for-frontend-developers

This is a collection of helpful APIs that provide dummy data that we can use as frontend engineers to build demos and proof of concepts. Sometimes you just really need a simple endpoint that gives you a list of products? or cats? maybe jokes? I'm hoping to make this an exhaustive list that we can all contribute to.
